Once wired, be sure to format your SD card to FAT32. Upload the video file you'd like to play upon joining and name it `your-video-file.mp4`. After that, upload the SD card version of the sketch to your ESP32 and insert the SD card into the reader.

## Non-SD Card Version

For the non-SD card version, youâ€™ll need to flash a shortened audio-only file to the ESP32 using [SPIFFS](https://www.programmingelectronics.com/spiffs-esp32/) and name it `your-audio-file.mp3`. Then, upload the non-SD card version of the sketch to the ESP32.
